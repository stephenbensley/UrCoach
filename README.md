# Ur Coach

UrCoach is an iOS app for the [Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur). The app lets you play against the computer or another human player (by pass-and-play). The computer implements a mathematically optimal strategy. You can learn a lot about the game by watching how the computer AI plays. When playing against the computer, you also have the option of displaying a detailed analysis of your available moves.
