**Rules**
The app follows the rules originally proposed by Irving Finkel. These are the mostly commonly played rules. This page assumes you are already familiar with them. If not, you can read the full details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur).

**Beginning the Game**
Players roll the dice to determine who goes first. The app skips any tied rolls and only shows the decisive roll. The player with the highest roll makes the first move.

**Moving Pieces**
The current player rolls the dice to determine how many squares to move during the turn. The player's dice are highlighted to indicate whose turn it is. Tap the piece you wish to move to select it. Both the selected piece and its destination will be highlighted. Tap the destination to confirm the move. If you are unable to select a piece, that means it has no move available. When entering a piece from off the board, you must select the highest piece from the stack of waiting pieces.

**Losing a Turn**
If you roll a zero or none of your pieces can make a move, play automatically passes to the other player.

**Earning an Extra Roll**
If you land on a rosette |rays|, you earn an extra roll. 

**Computer Oppponent**
The computer opponent plays a mathematically optimal strategy. You can learn a lot about the game by watching how the computer AI plays. The AI is hosted in the cloud because it's too large to run locally on a mobile device. Thus, playing against the computer requires an Internet connection. The computer does not cheat. The computer and the human player use the same code to generate their dice rolls.

**Analysis**
When playing against the computer, an Analyze button appears beneath the game board. Tap this to reveal the coach's analysis of your available moves. A percentage is displayed above each piece that can move. This is the probability of winning the game if you choose that move. The best move will appear in green. If you always play the green move, you will be playing an identical strategy to the computer opponent.
