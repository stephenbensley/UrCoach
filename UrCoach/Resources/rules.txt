Queah is a two-player strategy game played on a board with 13 spaces. Each player begins the game with ten pieces: four on the board and six in reserve. 

The player controlling the white pieces moves first, then the players alternate moves. 

Pieces normally move one step diagonally in any direction to an empty space.

A piece may instead capture an adjacent enemy piece by jumping over it to the space beyond, which must be empty. Only one piece can be captured per turn. If a player has a capturing move, they can not make a non-capturing move. If a player has multiple capturing moves, the player can choose which to make (but can only make one).

If a player has fewer than four pieces on the board, the player may choose to drop one of their reserve pieces onto any empty space. This is done instead of normal movement. A player may choose to drop a piece even if they have a capturing move available. Once a player has exhausted all their reserve pieces, then obviously no more drops can be made. Drops are optional; a player may choose to play short-handed and save the drop for a later turn.

A player wins by capturing all of their opponentâ€™s pieces or by blockading their opponent so that they have no moves available.

If the same board position repeats three times, the game is declared a draw by repetition.
